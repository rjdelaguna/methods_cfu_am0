# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
    - Not getting frustrated, even when things seemed to be moving along slower than I would have liked.
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
    - Methods allow you to do a job once and then simply reference the method again and again. They also let you complete complex jobs in a much quicker time frame.
